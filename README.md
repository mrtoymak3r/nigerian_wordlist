## 🚀 What's Inside  

Here's what you'll find in this repository:  

- **`clean_nigerian_names.txt`**  
  A list of Nigerian names free of duplicates and noise. Perfect for language models, NLP tasks, or when you need a clean dataset for testing.  

- **`common_nigerian_firstnames.txt`**  
  A hand-picked selection of the most commonly used Nigerian first names. Useful for generating culturally relevant examples or testing name-based systems.  

- **`common_nigerian_surnames.txt`**  
  A collection of popular Nigerian surnames. Great for creating test datasets or simulating Nigerian user profiles.  

- **`nigerian_states.txt`**  
  All 36 Nigerian states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) listed for reference, geolocation tasks, or form field validation.  

- **`nigeria_passwords.txt`**  
  A fascinating (and sometimes hilarious) list of common Nigerian passwords. Ideal for cybersecurity research, password strength training, or demonstrating the dangers of weak passwords. (🔒 *Use responsibly!*)
